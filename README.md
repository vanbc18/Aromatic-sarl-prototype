# Aromatic SARL - Prototype Website

This project is a prototype for a new website for Aromatic SARL, 
a company specializing in the distribution of beverages. 
The goal of this prototype is to present a modern, user-friendly, and visually appealing website that effectively 
showcases Aromatic SARL's products and services.

**Key Features:**

* **Modern and Responsive Design:** The prototype features a clean and modern design that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobile devices).
* **User-Friendly Navigation:** Intuitive navigation allows visitors to easily explore the website and find the information they need, except for opening hours, because it wasn't on the real website.
* **Product Showcase:** The prototype effectively showcases Aromatic SARL's product offerings with high-quality images and concise descriptions.
* **Contact Form:** A contact form allows visitors to easily inquire about products and services.

**Technologies Used:**

* **HTML5:** For the structural framework of the website.
* **CSS3:** For styling and layout.
* **JavaScript:** For interactive elements and enhanced user experience.
* **Bootstrap:** A popular front-end framework for rapid prototyping and responsive design.

**Note:**

This prototype is intended for demonstration purposes only and may not include all the functionalities of a fully-fledged website.
With this project, I learnt a lot about Bootstrap 5.3, which was fun, and boosted my productivity : it took me about a week to make everything really responsive,
even though I used a bootstrap template (templatemo-chain-app) to begin with.
In the future, I think I won't use templates anymore, so that I can navigate better in my html, css & js files.

**Future Considerations:**

* **E-commerce functionality:** To enable online orders and payments.
* **SEO optimization:** To improve search engine visibility and attract more organic traffic.
* **Advanced analytics:** To track user behavior and website performance.
